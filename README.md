# json_vm

Do you remember flow charts? Box is for bit to bit COPYing, diamond is for SELECTing next step based on a selector bit. So this is a "copy+select(jump)" VM, inspired from my BitBitJumpJump variation of BitBitJump esoteric language. Programs are stored in JSON format. Runs both in web-browser (check developer console!) and node/npm (use "npm install && npm start"). More example programs are in similar projects but coded in their format (translation needed).
